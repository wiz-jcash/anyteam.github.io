# start

Follow four simple steps to start working with the Any.Money system:

**Step 1.** Register an account at the [**Any.Money**](https://any.money) portal;

**Step 2.** Create and activate a merchant in your account;

**Step 3.** Make the necessary merchant's settings;

**Step 4.** To work with SCI a special [web form](sci_invoice.md#web_form) has to be added to your resource. Or configure [JSON-RPC client](auth.md) to work with the API.

_For queries authentication must be used merchant's **ID**. It can be found at the detailed description page in the main settings section. And an appropriate **secret key API** or **privat key SCI** situated in the security settings section._
